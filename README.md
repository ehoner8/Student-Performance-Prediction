**Introduction**
Many parents aim to set their children in an environment where they can thrive academically, but are unsure of which factors are the most important. This project uses data collected from two Portuguese secondary
schools, and contains 30 features about student, ranging from information about their parent's success, to their interests after high school, to what they spend their time doing outside of school hours. This 
analysis visualizes which features have strong effects on performance, and develops a model predicting student performance based on the given set of features.
